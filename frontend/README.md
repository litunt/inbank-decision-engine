# Front-end. Decision Engine (Inbank test assignment)

## Requirements

Angular 16.2.x, Node.js 18.x

## UX/UI solution
[PrimeNG](https://primeng.org/) UX/UI library is used as visualisation provider. This library allows to design custom
component theme with [Theme Designer](https://designer.primeng.org/#/) tool (choose theme colors, fonts etc, and also see
how the end result will look like on base components provided by PrimeNG). As a result, [theme.css](src/assets/styles/theme.css)
is being generated by the Designer tool, downloaded and added to the project styles.

## Structure of the source code

### Source code layers

- `_components` - sub-components of user interface pages that page consists of
- `_models` - data models used in front-end app
- `_services` - service layer for API requests, interceptors and additional app background functionality
- `_pages` - pages of user interface
